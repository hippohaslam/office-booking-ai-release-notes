# Hippo Office Bookings app

This application was built as an improvement on the old hippo booking process
of booking the desk as "room" in Google Calendar. This system was quite inefficient,
caused issues with duplicate bookings and was difficult to report on.

## Documentation

This folder will detail different parts of the application and how they work together.
