# How to contribute

This is a hippo internal project and therefore open for all Hippos to contribute to.

## Spotted an issue or have a suggestion?
If you have spotted an issue or have a suggestion for the project, please raise an issue in the issues tab.
We have made some templates to help you raise the issue, please use them where possible.
- If you have raised a bug, this will be looked at promptly and prioritised dependent on people's capacity and the urgency
  (such as whether this issue is blocking people from using the service)
- If you have raised a feature request, this may be reviewed by the facilities team and prioritised based on the value to the service.

## Want to contribute directly?
If you have already raised a bug/issue, or have spotted one that takes your interest, please assign it to yourself and get cracking :)
We will try tag issues where possible if things are either up for grabs or suitable for beginners.

We would like to encourage as many engineers as possible to contribute to this project, whether they are bored on the bench
or just want to do some PD on a real application.

You should find a variety of documentation in the form of README's and some files under the `docs` folder to help you get started.

You can also join #internal-office-bookings-eng channel on Slack for additional support.

All work must be done in a feature branch and then raised as a PR to the main branch. 
Specify a brief description of what you have worked on and tag any issue where appropriate.
Each PR will be reviewed by a code-owner and must also pass the build validation checks before being merged.
